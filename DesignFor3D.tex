\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Introduction}
  A number of items need to be considered when designing an object for 3D printing.  Some of them are generic while others may depend on the 3D printing technology used.
\end{frame}

\section{Measurements}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Measurements (units)}
  A good question is, ``What does one unit in the CAD program translate to when printed out?''.  Depending on your application, the answer may range from mildly interesting to vitally important.  If you are creating a stand alone decorative object, you may not care much as long as the result is a reasonable size.  If, however, you are designing a part to physically interface with some existing items, the answer is vitally important.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Measurements (accuracy)}
  There are three different items that impact the detail and accuracy of the print.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What is the resolution for printing bits of material? (note that x and y resolution may be different)
    \item What is the smallest bit of material that can be printed?
    \item What is the layer height?
  \end{itemize}
  Some or all of these may be adjustable on your printer.  In general, reducing the resolution makes the print go faster.
\end{frame}

\section{First Layer}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{First Layer}
  Depending on the type of printer and its settings, the first layer printed may be thinner or thicker that the subsequent layers.  This is usually accompanied with the material extending beyond or within the subsequent layers.  This effect is sometimes called ``elephant foot''.  The slicer program often has a setting for ``elephant foot compensation''.

\section{Holes and Voids}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Holes and Voids}
  The size of holes in a 3D printed object are generally less than specified because holes are printed as polygons.  The effect is more pronounced when the polygon has a small number of sides.

\section{Overhangs}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Overhangs}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For some types of printers (typically those that fuse a powder), overhangs and unsupported sections are not a problem.  For the rest, something may need to be done.
    \item A rule of thumb is that overhangs with an overhang angle less that 45\degree\ can print without too much trouble while larger angles will require support.
    \item There are test objects available online with varying overhang angles that you can use to see what your printer can do.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Angle of Overhangs}
  The angle of overhang is important in determining if your print will succeed or not.
  \begin{figure}
    \input{Overhang1}
    \caption{The Angle of Overhang}
  \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Unsupported Sections}
  If the Angle of Overhang exceeds 90\degree\ the printer will try to start printing a section on thin air (depending on the printer technology).  Thus usually does not end well.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item You can choose a printer technology, such as powder fusing methods, where the section would be supported by unfused powder.
    \item You may be able to reorient your part so there is no longer an unsupported section.
    \item You may be able to use the slicer program to automatically generate a support structure.
    \item You may be able to add a support structure to your design.
    \item Some combination of the above.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
